Technologies Used:
HTML
HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
The goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multi-media and other new features; 
to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices; 
and to remain backward compatible to older software. Many new symantec features are included.

CSS:
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language (such as HTML5). 
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content; including layout, colors, and fonts. 
This separation improves content accessibility to provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
enabling multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying relevant CSS in a separate file, 
which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content (HTML), 
as well as enabling the file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,
such as on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices.

JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (along with HTML and CSS). 
It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. JS is a multi-faceted, 
scripting language that provides versatility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, among others.

NODE.js represents a "Javascript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, 
rather than different programming languages for server- and client-side scripts.
